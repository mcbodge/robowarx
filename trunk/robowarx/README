This is RoboWarX, a clone of the Macintosh game RoboWar.

RoboWarX is incomplete, at the time of writing. However, simple bots and some
Tournament I bots have been tested and found to run. There's only half decent
error handling though, so if you try a too fancy robot it might take the
entire application down with it!

This is a source code package. There are two solution files, one for
Visual Studio 2008, and another for MonoDevelop 1.0.

After a build on Windows, run "RoboWarX.WinForms.exe".
Any other platform that has Mono and GTK# available can use them to run
"RoboWarX.GTK.exe". (Linux, Mac OS X with some effort, and others.)

Most glaring ommisions: (in order of personal importance)
 - Interrupts
 - Many weapons (just bullets and missiles implemented)
 - Editor
 - Debugger
 - Still a couple of special operators and registers
   (history, channel, signal, for example)
 - Sounds
 - Icons
 - GUI polish
 - Smaller things (look for FIXMEs!)
 - Perhaps a Mac OS X native interface?

You may also find that the Windows part of the code may be outdated.

Have fun!
