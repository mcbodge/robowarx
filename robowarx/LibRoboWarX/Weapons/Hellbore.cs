    // written (this is different than hellbores in RoboWar 2.1.2). This amount is removed from the
    // robot's energy supply. Hellbores reduce the shield of any robot they hit to zero but do no
    // other damage. They must move at a speed from 4 to 20 in the direction that the robot's
    // turret pointed when the shot was fired. Hellbores cannot be used unless they were first
    // enabled at the hardware store.
