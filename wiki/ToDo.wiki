#summary List of to-do items

= Introduction =

RoboWarX is very incomplete. This is a to-do list in wiki form, to replace the original README. Hopefully, this helps track things a bit better, and maybe even cross reference to useful info for whoever wants to tackle an item.

Items suffixed with bold names are being worked on by that person.

 * Weapons
   * Hellbores
   * Stunners
   * TacNukes
